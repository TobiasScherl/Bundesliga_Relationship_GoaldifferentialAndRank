# Bundesliga_Relationship_GoaldifferentialAndRank
Within this project the relationship between the goal differential and the rank in the Bundesliga table at the end of the season is analyzed. This analysis helps to analyze if a team overperformed or underperformed during a season.

## Data Collection and Understanding
The data is scraped from http://bulibox.de/abschlusstabellen/index.html. To scrape the data BeautifulSoup was used. The data was collected since the existence of the Bundesliga (1963/64 until 2020/21). To understand the data the correlation between the numeric columns was calculated. It becomes obvious that there are strong correlations between some variables (goal differential and rank, points and goals etc.)

Furthermore it was analyzed how often the teams won the Deutsche Meisterschaft in Bundesliga. Bayern MÃ¼nchen is the team with the most wins.

## Data Preparation
One season in Deutsche Bundesliga was played with 20 teams after Western and Eastern Germany got reunited. This season was excluded from the analysis in order to have only consistent numbers of teams (18 teams per season).

## Model Building
Afterwards a linear regression model was built. R2 score of the model is 0,80.
